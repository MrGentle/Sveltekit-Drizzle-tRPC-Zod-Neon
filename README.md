# SvelteKit + Drizzle + tRPC + Zod + Neon

Everything you need to start developing a modern full stack Svelte Kit project
Planning to add Lucia, Svelte Query and Svelte Superforms.

I suggest using shadcn-svelte for your UI

## Why tRPC, isn't that redundant?

Mainly because I enjoy the way tRPC deals with routes, middleware, and how it plays with Zod.
You can also easily integrate it with Svelte Query.

# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
